# EntitasGenerics

An experiment to replace the code generation part of EntitasECS C# version with generics.

Currently working in the context of this Entitas example project: https://github.com/RomanZhu/Match-Line-Entitas-ECS

Note: work in progress... i am slowly replacing all the game code with the new implementation.

* The code to replace generation is in the "Assets\Libs\Entitas-Generics" folder.
* Generating files will break everything.
