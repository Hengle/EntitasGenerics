# EntitasGenerics

An experiment to replace the code generation part of EntitasECS C# version with generics.

Currently working in the context of this Entitas example project: https://github.com/RomanZhu/Match-Line-Entitas-ECS

Note: work in progress...

* My changes are (mostly) in the "Generic" folder. 
* Regenerating the files will probably break everything because i have some hacks in the contexts file.
